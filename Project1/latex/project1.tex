% [Report] Abstract:
% Summarize the content of the entire document in one or two paragraphs.
% Focus on key achievements.

In this project, we design a controller for a two mass - one spring, cart system. The goal is to optimize the performance of the second cart's response to a step input to the reference through control of the first cart's behavior, with respect to several key control metrics. We look at optimizing for a very short settling time along with minimizing the amount of overshoot. The 'undershoot' is treated as an acceptable behavior since the cart will pass through this region, so we give ourselves the difficulty of treating the overshoot as a highly undesirable set.
We achieve our goals with a settling time under three seconds along with less than one percent overshoot.

\section{Introduction}
% [Report] Introduction:
% Should generally cover:
% 1) Brief, self-contained description of the basic problem 
% 2) Summary and references to prior/related work 
% 3) Short paragraph on organization of this report.
We begin our control journey with the search of an optimal controller. The first idea here is LQR, but it is clear that we have noise in our system and uncertainty in our data, so we consider going to LQG. We try to decrease our uncertainty by doing a sinusoidal sweep of 20 frequencies. 
% Provide context on the overall goal of your project:
% - E.g., “This lab project deals with … [controller design / system identification / etc.]”
% - Summarize what is known or what has been done before.
% - Outline the subsequent sections.

% Example:
%  - 1 paragraph describing the problem
%  - 1 paragraph describing prior related work
%  - 1 paragraph summarizing your contributions and how the rest of the report is organized

% Insert note about the planning aspect (mentioned in [Report] “Plan ahead …”)

% ---------------------------------------------------
\section{System Identification}
\label{sec:systemID}

% [Report] System description:
% “Briefly describe the model of the process you are controlling, 
% explain meaning of the variables, their units, control input(s), measured output(s).”

\subsection{Process to be controlled}
% [Report] Provide a concise description of:
% - The physical system
% - Notation for variables, units
% - Control input(s) and measured output(s)
% For example, mention x1, x2, etc., masses, motor parameters, etc.
% Possibly include a figure

The process we are controlling is a two cart system
connected by a spring. The system is driven by a motor that's given a voltage $V$ [Volt], which
produces a force $F$ [N] applied to the first cart with mass $m_1$ [kg], and the second cart
with mass $m_2$ [kg] is connected to the first cart via a spring with spring constant $k$ [N/m].
In this system, $x_1$ [m] is the position of the first cart, and $x_2$ [m] is the position of the second cart.
The control input is the voltage $u := V$ [Volt] applied to the motor, and the measured output
is the position $y := x_2$ [m] of the second cart.

\subsection{Non-Parametric Identification}
% [Report] For the non-parametric approach:
% 1) Frequencies/amplitudes used and why
% 2) Plots with magnitude/phase
% 3) Comparison with parametric identification

The non-parametric identification method used was sine-wave testing in conjunction with
the correleation method. This strategy consists of applying sinusoidal inputs at distinct frequencies
to calculate the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at that frequency from the
output of the system.

\subsection{Parametric Identification}
% [Report] For the parametric approach:
% 1) Inputs used (square waves, chirp, etc.) and rationale
% 2) Plots showing input and output signals (representative examples)
% 3) Discussion of chosen model order, justification
% 4) Bode plots (magnitude and phase) of identified model
% 5) Comparison with non-parametric approach

% - Step response plots for the closed-loop system 
%   (using the identified model AND the nominal model from ECE147A&B, if relevant)

%    and possible reasons for them
